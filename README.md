# Welcome to ZezHub 
I'm a multidiscipllinary engineer passionate about **embedded systems**, **robotics**, **open-source hardware**, and **intelligent firmware**. My projects blend low-level performance with real-world applications.

Currently working on Kestrel, an Open source environmental logger at the University of Minnesota GEMS Informatics Lab
